# Implementation of recursives algorithms for Doubly Linked List

Implements new recursive algorithms such as binary search, merge sort and quicksort. There are also additional tweaks to current methods, in addition to adding a constructor for DLinkedList.

Currently, there is a new searchShape algorithm that search in the list a shape, and if match, returns its node. If the list is sorted, it will use a binary search algorithm and if not, it will use a regular iteration method.
