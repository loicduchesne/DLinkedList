# Basic implementation of Doubly Linked List

Basic implementation of a Doubly Linked List with its object class template "Shape" for the context of COMP 250 at McGill University.

Holds basic methods for list operations + bubbleSort() & selectionSort() algorithm to sort the elements within the list. There is also a detectLoop() method that uses Floyd's Tortoise & Hare Algorithm to detect if there is an accidental loop in the list itself.

Dev branch holds the additional insertionSort() algorithm with its respective node operation methods to make it function correctly. The code has been reorganized, but missing comments at the new methods. Extensive testing was not done yet for the dev branch, results may not be accurate.
