# (DEV) optimization of recursive algorithms for Doubly Linked List

Re-implementation of the recursive sorting algorithms (mergeSort & quickSort) using the node operations
instead of having an ArrayList foundation for its sorting. Should save runtime by removing the requirement
for having to iterate through all the elements to set them in the ArrayList.
