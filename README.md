# Basic implementation of Doubly Linked List

Basic implementation of a Doubly Linked List with its object class template "Shape" for the context of COMP 250 at McGill University.

Holds basic methods for list operations + bubbleSort(), selectionSort() & insertionSort() algorithm to sort the elements within the list. Additionally, it contains node operations required to make the algorithms function properly. There is also a detectLoop() method that uses Floyd's Tortoise & Hare Algorithm to detect if there is an accidental loop in the list itself.
