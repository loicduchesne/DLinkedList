# Generification of Doubly Linked List

This branch is responsible for the development related to the transition to Generic Types for this 
Doubly Linked List. It consists of all the main DLinkedList code reformatting, in addition to a new
Interface called WeightedObject. It also includes a couple addition to the template Shape class to
follow WeightedObject's standards.

The Interface WeightedObject sets standards for what kind of object DLinkedList expects to operate 
with, including important methods for the normal function of DLinkedList.
